# Web3 Security Community of Practice

In this repo we will schedule, organize and document CoP meetings related to web3 security.

Here's what you should know:
- This is a self-organized, time boxed weekly meeting for white hat hackers.
- The goal is to discuss various blockchain security topics, bugs and vulnerabilities.
- If you want to reserve a slot for a discussion or present something - open a issue in this repo and you will be added to the agenda. An [example](https://github.com/georgiIvanov/web3_security_cop/issues/1).
- Topics on the agenda will be discussed with priority.
- Once all scheduled discussions are over, everyone is free to ask on/off topic questions.
- When necessary additional notes will be added for the meeting so that participants can have a later reference.
