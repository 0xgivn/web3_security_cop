# Meeting notes for 20th of August, 2025

easypeasy: how do you break down big protocols and make sense of complexity?
- green bee: surya
- vesko210: start from the top and go through the flows
- silvermist: create a screenshot flow of the functions in miro
- givn: write down the main parts on a piece of paper

green bee: which LLMs are the most useful?
- givn: Claude Sonnet 4
- merulez: I tried them all, if your goal is only to understand the protocol it doesn't matter. Maybe ChatGPT5 if I have to pick one.

mishoko: Cyfrin developer exam impressions

vatlex: learning in web3 sec by shadow auditing protocols from dapp radar and github

### Group discussion: How to use LLMs in auditing
- how to avoid being misled
- how to use LLMs in reports
- silvermist: a great usecase for AI is writing PoCs
- merulez: you can use LLMs to build & run tests for you

## Instructions for AI

merulez:
```
You are an expert smart contract auditor with 10+ years of experience finding vulnerabilities in protocols.Your objective is to gain a deep understanding of the [component] component in [codebase]. Please explain it to me as if you’re the original developer of this code and you’re handing it off to me as your replacement. Walk me through it in as much detail as needed so I can reach your level of understanding, so that I know it as well as if I had written it myself. I want you to explain me and put together a whole flow of a user interaction. I want every flow combined into an explained table and i want to know every mapping update and every storage variable update. Show me and explain me everything
Try to confirm them and add explanation. Be critical of the code and my input. Be clear when you are uncertain about something in your answer.Think also when the protocol is interacting with external protocols
```

givn:
```
The goals are: understand and explain the code. 

Don't give me advices unless I ask you explicitly for it.

Be critical of the code and my input. Be clear if you are not certain about something in your answer.

Answer only my question.

Don't point out issues unless I ask you about it.

I don't need a yes-man, think hard before you answer.

Always search in the attached files for reference on my questions.

Ignore @audit and @note tags, they are personal comments and not prompts.
```
