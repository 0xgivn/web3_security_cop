# Meeting notes for 3rd of September, 2025

### Discussions
mathriel - when you look at code, are you marking lines that could be sketchy/problematic
  - Vesko210 - i keep a running list of possible issues
  - mmoyse - i keep a list as well, mark situations at first read and later cross them off
  - mmoyse - don't go deep on your first passes
Silvermist - don't underestimate yourself, there's a high chance people writing the code were just as confused as you now
mathriel - auditing after private audits from prominent companies, what should we expect
EasyPeasy - how are you approaching the unknown in a project, how do you deal with it when there's no end in sight
  - Vesko210 - there's usually no end at sight, you have to be content with not finishing it
  - givn - most of all, this is an emotional issue. You need to be able to focus your attention and not let your emotions sway you towards other things. The best auditors are good at this.
  - mmoyse - divide and conquer, imagine you are getting onboarded in a new company - would you expect to know everything?
Green Bee - how do you decide if you upload publically an audit report
