	- Once complexity and size increases, working horizontally starts to become a bottleneck.
Thus, inverting and focusing on one thing is better:

- [silvermist](https://x.com/0xSilvermist) - motivation and grit in long audits, skills required to find bugs in large projects
- mmoyse - how do we learn and how to overcome biases when reading code
- mmoyse - are public contests truly dead?

### Reports
- [0xGivn](https://x.com/0xGivn) - [aquarius amm & uniswap v2 fee calculation](https://cantina.xyz/code/990ce947-05da-443e-b397-be38a65f0bff/findings/380) - why is this a bug and not just an economic side-effect?
- [Merulez99](https://x.com/Merulez99) - superform front-running escalation, yet again.
	- Key Takeaway: Make sure to assess the impact of your finding correctly. Changing it during escalation will invalidate your report.
